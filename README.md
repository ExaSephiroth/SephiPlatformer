# SephiPlatformer

Old platformer game I made a couple of years ago.
Saving here for nostalgic sake.

You're playing as Sephiroth and the goal of the game is to kill Aeris by jumping on her.
(I refuse to explain who Sephiroth and Aeris are as I hopefully assume they are common knowledge).

Using C# and the XNA framework.
The beginnings were based on a tutorial from xnafan.net
